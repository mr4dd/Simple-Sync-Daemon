# Simple Sync Daemon

a simple file syncing utility to sync specific kinds of files and directories to my server, the reason im writing something from scratch instead of using rsync or rclone is because my server has a very specific set of rules for file sorting and distribution that would make maintaining those command flags tedious

# LICENSE

I dont really see the utility for anyone other than me since this is way worse than any other project out there but its MIT licensed so do what you want with it lol, see [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) for more
